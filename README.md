   1. S - Single Responsibilty.  ( Each class should have only single responsibilty)
   2. O - Open For Extension & Closed For Modiication. 
   3. L - Liskov Substitution. ( Derived class should be replaced by the base class )
   4. I - Interface Seggregation. ( Like classes interfaces also having only single responsibilty ) 
   5. D - Dependency Inversion. ( One class should not depend on other class )
